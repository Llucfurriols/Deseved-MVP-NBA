Filtered out past MVPs with no blocks or steals.
Project Overview
We embarked on our project focusing on the NBA, leveraging the wealth of statistics available online. While Kaggle didn't offer relevant datasets, we found BasketballReference.com to be a goldmine of NBA data.

Objective
We aimed to scrutinize the fairness of the MVP award for the 2022-2023 NBA season. The contentious nature of Joel Embiid's win prompted our investigation. Initial favorite Nikola Jokić and other contenders like Giannis Antetokounmpo added fuel to the debate.

Methodology
Data Acquisition: Retrieved essential datasets including player stats, team stats, and historical MVP data.
Data Filtering: Narrowed down potential MVP candidates based on games played, minutes, and statistical performance.
Metric Development: Utilized Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and other metrics to objectively assess player performance.
MVP Criteria Formulation: Formulated criteria aligning with four common MVP definitions: best player, most outstanding player, best player on the best team, and most valuable to his team.
Analysis: Applied the formulated criteria to determine MVPs according to each definition.
Visualization: Visualized candidate performance using 4D and 2D plots for easier interpretation.
Comparison with Past MVPs: Evaluated this season's MVP contenders against historical MVPs using similar criteria.
Findings
MVP Analysis: Nikola Jokić emerged as the MVP according to three out of four defined criteria.
Visualization: Utilized 4D plots to visualize candidate performance across multiple MVP definitions.
Comparative Analysis: Compared this season's MVP contenders with past MVPs, revealing interesting insights into historical MVP performances.
Conclusion
While statistical analysis provides valuable insights, the MVP selection process remains subjective. Despite statistical prowess, other factors such as leadership and defensive contributions often influence MVP decisions. Our analysis sheds light on the complexities of MVP selection, offering a nuanced perspective on this season's MVP race.

Further Considerations
Leadership and intangible qualities play a significant role in MVP selection, which cannot be quantified solely through statistics.
Injuries and team dynamics also influence player performance and MVP candidacy.
Continuous refinement of metrics and analysis techniques can enhance the accuracy and depth of future MVP assessments.
