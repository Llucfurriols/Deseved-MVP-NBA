# **Project Summary**

Obtained datasets from CSV files.

## **Project Background**
We initiated our project with a keen interest in the NBA, considering its abundance of statistics and readily available datasets online. Despite initial searches on platforms like Kaggle yielding no useful datasets, we discovered basketball-reference.com, a treasure trove of NBA data and statistics. Our aim was to investigate the fairness of the MVP award for the 2022-2023 NBA season. This season's MVP, Joel Embiid, sparked controversy, with Nikola Jokić and Giannis Antetokounmpo also vying for the title.

## **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
We began by uploading data to our Python notebook, employing familiar methodologies such as using Pandas for importing CSV files. We meticulously obtained four datasets: primary player statistics, advanced player statistics, team statistics, and MVP statistics from basketball-reference.com. Before uploading, we ensured data integrity by removing or modifying potentially problematic entries.

## **Data Filtering**
With over 500 players initially, we narrowed our focus to 25 MVP candidates through rigorous filtering criteria. We eliminated players with minimal game time and focused on essential basketball statistics such as points and Player Efficiency Rating (PER). Our aim was to ensure that our MVP candidates were statistically significant and representative.

## **MVP Determination**
Utilizing four distinct MVP definitions (best player, most outstanding player, best player on the best team, most valuable to his team), we devised formulas to objectively evaluate MVP candidates. Despite some data limitations, we successfully determined MVPs according to each definition, with Nikola Jokić emerging as the primary contender across multiple criteria.

## **Visualization and Analysis**
We visualized our findings through 4D and 2D plots, enabling easier interpretation of MVP candidates' performances. Furthermore, we conducted histogram and scatter plot analyses to compare the top 25 candidates and validate their statistical prowess.

## **Conclusion**
While our approach isn't flawless and may overlook certain intangible aspects of player performance, our results closely align with professional critiques and offer valuable insights into MVP candidacy. Our analysis highlights the complexity of MVP selection and the importance of considering various statistical metrics. Ultimately, our findings contribute to the ongoing discourse surrounding NBA MVP awards.

## **Comparison to Previous MVPs**
In a bid to contextualize our findings, we compared current MVPs, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokić, with past MVPs using historical data. Despite data limitations, we successfully evaluated past MVPs, shedding light on the statistical prowess of contemporary players relative to NBA history.
